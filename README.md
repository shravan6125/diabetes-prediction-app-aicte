##  Problem Statement

Millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes without early detection. Timely prediction can help manage lifestyle and reduce medical emergencies. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming, and there's a need for a system that quickly identifies high-risk individuals using key medical data.

---

##  Proposed Solution

The project implements a real-time web-based system using Streamlit and a machine learning model (SVM) trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It takes user input (like glucose level, BMI, etc.) and predicts the likelihood of diabetes.

---

## âš™ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **scikit-learn** (SVM classifier)
- **Streamlit** (Frontend)
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **StandardScaler** (Data normalization)

---

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Form-based web UI for patient data entry
- Real-time prediction
- Model trained on standardized data
- Deployment-ready with saved model (`model.pkl`)
